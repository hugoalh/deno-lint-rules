# `hugoalh/no-duplicate-export-sources`

> ✔️ Recommended; Enable by default.

Forbid duplicate [`export`][ecmascript-export] sources.

Multiple [`export`][ecmascript-export]s with same source is a bad practice and cause confusion, which have the same effect as single [`export`][ecmascript-export] with same source, possibly mergeable.
